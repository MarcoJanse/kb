## Introduction

The example below is for submitting an update to Bicep Cli to the WinGet repository

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
  - I highly recommend to sign your commits. See [Using a Yubikey with GitHub for signing your commits | ictstuff.info](https://ictstuff.info/using-a-Yubikey-with-github-for-signing-your-commits)
- Windows machine with WinGet client
- The Wingetcreate latest version installed.
  - `winget install wingetcreate`
- Created a fork of [winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs) on GitHub.
- Activated the [Windows Sandbox optional feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview) on your client machine.
  - I personally had some issues with the PowerShell command `Install-WindowsOptionalFeature`, so I used the GUI to install this:
    - Apps > Optional Features - More Windows Features
    - Check `Windows Sandbox` and reboot

## Steps

### Preparation and validation

For the Bicep Cli, I have subscribed to the repository's releases using the *watch* option - *custom* and selecting only `releases`

The instructions below are based on the release of [Bicep v0.27.1](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/tag/v0.27.1)

- Check the open Pull requests on [microsoft/winget-pkgs on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/pulls), to make sure nobody has already submitted this package
  - Use this as a search filter: `is:pr is:open "bicep" in:title`
- On the release page of Bicep v.0.18.4, find the `bicep-setup-win-x64.exe` package and copy the link for the next step

> **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you copy the `bicep-setup-win-64.exe` and not the bicep-win64.exe

### Create the winget manifest files for the installer package

- On your machine, open a PowerShell prompt and enter the following: `wingetcreate update --urls <link to bicep-setup-win-x64-package> --version <versionNumber> <Winget.PackageName>`, so in this case this should be:
  - `wingetcreate update --urls https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/download/v0.27.1/bicep-setup-win-x64.exe --version 0.27.1 Microsoft.Bicep`
- This will create the following manifest files on your PC in the `C:\Users\<username>\manifests\m\Microsoft\Bicep\<0.xx.x>`
  - Microsoft.Bicep.installer.yaml
  - Microsoft.Bicep.locale.en-US.yaml
  - Microsoft.Bicep.yaml

### Modify the manifest files and store them in a new branch of your forked repository

- In GitHub, make sure your forked repository is synced
- In VSCode, open your fork repository
  - Make sure you are in the main/master branch
- Create a new branch from main/master.
  - In this case, I named the branch `feat-microsoft-bicep-v0.27.1`
- Switch to the new branch and create a new folder called `manifests\m\Microsoft\Bicep\0.27.1`
- Copy the 3 manifest files in this folder.
- Modify the following:
  - `Microsoft.Bicep.installer.yaml`
    - Add a `ReleaseDate: 'yyyy-MM-dd` line with the release date of this version
  - `Microsoft.Bicep.locale.en-US.yaml`
    - Add a `ReleaseNotes` parameter and copy the details from the releasenotes page, for example:

      ```text
      ReleaseNotes: |-

    - Add a `ReleaseNotesUrl` parameter, for example:
      - `ReleaseNotesUrl: https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/tag/v0.27.1`
- Save the files and do not commit them yet.

### Validate the manifest files

- Open a PowerShell console session for this.
- Validate your manifest files using winget cli.
  - **Be sure to validate the modified manifest files in your git branch, not the original location**
  - For example:
    - `winget validate X:\git\GitHub\MarcoJanse\winget-pkgs\manifests\m\Microsoft\Bicep\0.27.1\`
- If everything is alright, it should say *`Manifest validation succeeded`*

### Test the manifest with Windows Sandbox

- Using PowerShell console session, navigate to your winget repository branch
- **Make sure you are still in the branch with the new manifest files, and not in master/main branch.**
  - For example: `cd X:\git\github\MarcoJanse\winget-pkgs\Tools\`
- Run the following to test the installation of Bicep using the manifest file in Windows Sandbox environment
  - `.\SandboxTest.ps1 ..\manifests\m\Microsoft\Bicep\0.27.1\`
- This will list the output below, open a Windows Sandbox environment where you should see a successful installation of the Bicep Cli.
- If you don't see a successful installation, create a new issue in the source repository, in this case. [Azure/Bicep: Issues](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/issues)

```powershell
─ .\SandboxTest.ps1 ..\manifests\m\Microsoft\Bicep\0.27.1\                                 
--> Validating Manifest
Manifest validation succeeded.

--> Checking dependencies
--> Starting Windows Sandbox, and:
    - Mounting the following directories:
      - C:\Users\MarcoJanse\AppData\Local\Temp\SandboxTest as read-only
      - C:\git\GitHub\MarcoJanse\winget-pkgs\Tools as read-and-write
    - Installing WinGet
    - Configuring Winget
    - Installing the Manifest 0.27.1
    - Refreshing environment variables
    - Comparing ARP Entries
```

Below is a screenshot of the sandbox and it's output if everything works.

### Commit an push your changes

- In VSCode, in your branch commit the 3 files and enter a commit message:
  - For example: `feat: microsoft-bicep-v0.27.1`
- Sync/pull changes to the remote repository.
  - Make sure you sync to your forked branch, not the original.

### Create a pull request to the microsoft/winget-pkgs repository

- Using GitHub, go to your forked winget-pkgs repository
  - Select your feature branch
  - Select your commit. (commit ahead)
- You should automatically get a compare between your commit and the base repository (microsoft/winget-pkgs) on the master/main branch.
- Verify the following:
  - base repository: `microsoft/winget-pkgs` and base: `master`
  - head repository: `MarcoJanse/winget-pkgs` and base: `feat-microsoft-bicep-v0.27.1`
  - *Able to merge* message is displayed
- Select ***[Create Pull Request]***
- Review all the questions and put an `x` between the brackets when it's okay.
- Select ***[Submit]*** if everything is okay
  - This will start the pipelines for validation and approval. The pipeline validation should finish successfully within approximately an hour. The approval after successful validation depends on a reviewer with write access and could take several days.

### After successful merging of your pull request

After the pull request has been approved and merged into main

- Check if the package is available using `winget upgrade` and if so update using `winget upgrade microsoft.Bicep` or `winget upgrade --all`
- On GitHub, go your your forked winget-pkgs repository and sync it with upstream.
- Open the master branch of your localy cloned fork
  - Fetch and pull the updates into main
- Back on GitHub, remove the old feature branch that has been merged
- Back on your client do a `git fetch --prune`
  - This should list the local feature branch as deleted
- Remove the local branch using `git branch -D feat-microsoft-bicep-v0_xx.x`
  - The `-D` is necessary as this branch has been merged in the upstream and not in your forked master branch.
